Witch's Brew
<br>
by Sara Beslic, Corinna Huber, Helene Urban, Nicoleta Dublea

Witch‚Äôs Brew‚Äù is a dark, low-poly 3D adventure game set in a haunted forest. You play as Raven, a young witch who must collect ingredients, brew magical potions, and banish ghostly enemies that spawn from an ancient graveyard. 
Guided by Wisp, a mysterious moth-like creature, players explore a small open world filled with spooky atmosphere and magical danger. This project was created to apply and combine skills in 3D modeling, animation, 
Unity programming, and game audio. It represents our first complete game developed as a team

## Story
In the twilight-drenched forest of Black Hollow, a young witch named Raven stirs her cauldron, desperate to cleanse her haunted home. 
Once a place of peace, the forest is now stalked by restless ghosts, echoes of an ancient curse. These spirits feed on fear, growing stronger in the dark old woods.
‚Ä®Armed only with her cunning and her potions, Raven must face each ghost and banish them all to restore the forest‚Äôs peace‚Äîor be consumed by the spirits that hunger¬†in¬†the¬†shadows.

### Ending
With the last ghost banished, a calm silence returns to the forest. Raven‚Äôs potions have driven away the darkness, and the woods can finally breathe again. 
She stands among the whispering trees, knowing that peace has been restored‚Äîat least, for now.

## Characters
**Main Character**
<br>
(Witch, human)
<br>
Name: Raven

**Side Character**
<br>
(Moth)‚Ä®Name: Wisp

**Enemies**
<br>
Ghosts

## Goal
The player‚Äôs ultimate goal is to cleanse the forest by defeating all the ghosts haunting the world.
To do this, they can craft up to five unique potions, each with its own effect. Ingredients are scattered throughout the world and must be gathered to brew potions at the cauldron inside the witch‚Äôs home.
When a ghost appears, the player must quickly choose the right potion and throw it at the ghost to kill it. But beware ‚Äî if the ghosts get too close and deal too much damage, it's game over!

## System Design
**Player role:**
<br>
The player takes on the role of a witch in a third-person perspective. To cleanse her haunted forest of ghosts, 
she must brew potions using ingredients found in the woods. 
However, she must remain cautious - ghosts lurk in the shadows.
<br>
**The witch‚Äôs Book:**
<br>
Her ancient book contains recipes for potions, listing all the necessary ingredients she must gather. 
Each potion has a unique effect, essential for battling the ghosts.
<br>
**The ghosts:**
<br>
Ghost health depletes based on the potion used (Burn = fast damage etc.). 
Their movement and attack patterns will be polished later to align with the rest of the game visuals and logic.
