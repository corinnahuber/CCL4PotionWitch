  potionDescription: "Distilled from the sun\u2019s wrath, with Sunfruit\u2019s searing
    essence.\n\nThis fiery concoction hisses and crackles inside its vial, eager
    to be unleashed. When thrown, it lashes out with scorching fury, depleting a
    third of an enemy\u2019s health. Its heat is relentless, forged during a solar
    eclipse and sealed in crystal glass to contain its wrath. Smells of singed herbs
    and molten gold.\n\n"
