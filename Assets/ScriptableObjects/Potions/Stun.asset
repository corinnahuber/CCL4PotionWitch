  potionDescription: "Moondew and Glowleaf blend to bind time itself.\n\nA shimmering
    silver elixir that dances in the vial like starlight on still water. The Stun
    Potion suspends its victim in a daze, locking their senses for 3 seconds \u2014
    enough time to vanish, strike, or escape. Best brewed during lunar convergence,
    it hums faintly when near danger, as if hungry for chaos.\n\n"
