  potionDescription: 'Made from the heart of flame, Emberbloom.


    A warm, glowing
    liquid that pulses with life itself. The Heal Potion is brewed at dawn under
    the first rays of sunlight. One sip rekindles your inner fire, mending wounds
    and restoring one full heart. The Emberbloom petal within glows faintly, even
    in the darkest pouch, always ready to offer comfort and renewal.
