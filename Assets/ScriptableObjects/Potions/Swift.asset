  potionDescription: 'Fleet as whispers, and twice as elusive. Brewed with Whispergrass
    and Duskmoss.


    This misty blue potion grants a surge of speed so sudden
    it feels like time itself slows around you. Ideal for daring escapes or swift
    strikes, its effects last 10 heart-pounding seconds. Leaves behind a ghostly
    trail and the scent of twilight. Drink only if you can handle the thrill of vanishing
    wind.'
