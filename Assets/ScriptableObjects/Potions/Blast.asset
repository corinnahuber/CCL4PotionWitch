  potionDescription: "Darkest brew of destruction, born from Shadowroot and Nightberry.\n\nThe
    Ritest Potion is death in a bottle \u2014 a swirling void that devours light
    and mercy alike. Brewed during the witching hour beneath a new moon, it depletes
    all of an enemy\u2019s health. It\u2019s said that those who fall to its power
    vanish without a trace, their souls caught in the twisting fog that follows the
    scent of its bitter smoke."
